0.03 - 2014-09-20T19:29:17+01:00

  [DOCUMENTATION]

  - Add a .gitignore file

  - Changelog dates are better written as YYYY.MM.DD and probably ordered in
    the other, descending, direction
    Remark: I have decided to follow the ISO 8601 standard at
    http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime

  - Just use a Makefile.PL and not a Build.PL the latter does not have any
    added value any more
  - In Makefile.PL ==> meta files link to repository

0.02 - 2013-02-23T12:00:00+01:00

  [BUG FIX]

  - Fix an obvious bug in sub readch_block where the initial call to readch_noblock
    was missing. The effect of this bug was that while normal keyboard input was processed
    correctly, a copy/paste action only processed the first character. This bug is now fixed
    with version 0.02

0.01 - 2012-12-11T12:00:00+01:00
