Revision history for Win32-Readch

0.01    11 Dec 2012
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02    23 Feb 2013
        Fix an obvious bug in sub readch_block where the initial call to readch_noblock
        was missing. The effect of this bug was that while normal keyboard input was processed
        correctly, a copy/paste action only processed the first character. This bug is now fixed
        with version 0.02
